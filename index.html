    Charles Babbage is widely considered to be the father of the
    computer. The amazing thing is: he was able to concieve of a
    primitive computer (and a printer!) in 1822, yet engineering the materials to produce its parts would
    not be possible for decades, or so it was once thought until
    recently; his difference engine was finally
    realized as late as 1991, it worked perfectly, as did the printer
    - both engineered to his exact specifications. This proved, once
    and for all, that his difference engine would have worked, had the
    British Government not cut his funding in 1842.

        <i>"On two occasions I have been asked-'Pray, Mr.Babbage, if you
        put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers
        come out?' In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other
        a member of the Lower House put this question. I am not able
        rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could
        provoke such a question." </i>
